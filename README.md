# Claims-and-Consensus
  Claims and Consensus is an informative debate application that will make its users question their opinions about various topics and casual events such as street animals, euthanasia etc. The main purpose of the app is to make users compromise on these topics. Conversations are made in rooms and per room contain 4 users. When the debate starts, the first user (randomly chosen) will express his idea about the topic and the turn passes to the second user. Because there is a live opinion expressed, the second player will have three options which are "Agree", "Disagree" and "No Idea". If "Agree" is chosen, turn passes to the next player; if "No Idea" is chosen, he gains an oppurtunity to ask a question about the live opinion to its owner. If "Disagree" is chosen, then the user has to express a counter-argument to the room. This new opinion becomes the "live opinion" and the old one becomes a "frozen opinion" and turn passes to the next user. If all 3 of users agree on the live opinion, it becomes and "accepted opinion" and the last frozen opinion that was argued becomes the live opinion. (It's a stack structure.) When the users agree on all of the arguments the debate ends. Each turn consists of 45 seconds. If no interactions in this time period, the user is admitted as if he choosed "No Idea". A user becoming late twice will be out of debate.
